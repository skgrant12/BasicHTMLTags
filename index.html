        <p> This is Crispy. He is roughly 3 years old. We're not sure where he came from originally, but we got him at the <a href="https://www.hamiltonhumane.com/" target="blank">Hamilton County Humane Society</a>. My favorite quirk about him is that he has a crooked ear!</p>

                <p> This is Pumpkin. We got her in October 2021 and thought the name was fitting. She is about 1.5 years old. Interestingly, she has already had a litter of kittens. We got her from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PawsOnMyHeartInc/">Paws On My Heart Rescue.</a>Although she is a little younger than Crispy and we introduced her second, the two get along very well!</p>
